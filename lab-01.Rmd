### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
visitors <- read_csv("data/UK-visitor-numbers.csv")
```



# Wrangling Data

## Question 1

_How many tourist attractions are there in the data set?_

```{r Q1}
visitors %>% count()
```

### Exercise a.

_Create a frequency table of the number of tourist attractions in the data set by `region`._

```{r Ex_a}
# Delete the comment '#' symbol at the start of the next line and complete the code. 

visitors %>% count(region)
```

### Exercise b.

_Create a frequency table by `admission` and `setting`._

```{r Ex_b}
# Delete the comment '#' symbol at the start of the next line and complete the code.

visitors %>% count(admission, setting)
```


## Question 2

_What are the variable data types?_

```{r Q2_part1}
class(visitors$n_2022)
```

```{r Q2_part2}
visitors %>% summarise_all(class)
```



## Question 3

_Which attraction had the most number of visitors in 2022?_

```{r Q3}
visitors %>% arrange(desc(n_2022))
```

### Exercise c.

_What are the top 10 most visited attractions in 2021?_
```{r Ex_c}
visitors %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_2021)) %>%
  head(n = 10)
```

## Question 4

_What is the admission charge for the `"National Museum of Scotland"`?_

```{r Q4}
visitors %>% filter(attraction == "National Museum of Scotland")
```


### Exercise d.

_Which attraction had exactly 565,772 visitors in 2022?_

```{r Ex_d}
visitors %>% filter(n_2022 == 565772)
```

### Exercise e.

_How many attraction had more than 1 million visitors in 2022?_

```{r Ex_e}
visitors %>% 
  filter(n_2022 > 1000000) %>%
  count()
```

## Question 5

_How many `"O"`utside attractions are there in the `"Yorkshire and the Humber"` region that gives `"Members"` free admission, which had more than 100,000 visitors in 2022?_

```{r Q5}
visitors %>%
  filter(
    setting == "O",
    region == "Yorkshire and the Humber",
    admission == "Members",
    n_2022 >= 100000
    ) %>%
  count()
```

### Exercise f.

_How many attractions had between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors in 2022?_

```{r Ex_f}
visitors %>% 
  filter(
    n_2022 > 50000,
    n_2022 < 100000 ) %>%
  count()
```

### Exercise g.

_How many regions have more than 50 tourist attraction in the data set? (Hint: You will need to tabulate the data before filtering.)_

```{r Ex_g}
visitors %>% 
  count(region) %>%
  filter(n > 50) %>%
  count()
```



# Summarising Data

## Question 6

_What are the mean and median visitor numbers in 2022 across all attractions?_

```{r Q6}
visitors %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_2022 = mean(n_2022),
    med_2022 = median(n_2022)
  )
```


### Exercise h.

_Perform the same calculation for the 2021 admissions data._

```{r Ex_h}
visitors %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_2021 = mean(n_2021, na.rm = TRUE),
    med_2021 = median(n_2021, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```


### Exercise i.

_What does `NA` stand for and why are you getting this as your answer to the previous question._

NA stands for not available and means that the mean/median cannot be computed because the NA values in the data set have not been removed and both mean and median only take floats as their values, so will not work with NA values. However the NA values have been removed by na.rm = TRUE and hence the answer to my previous question is fine.




### Exercise j.

_Look at the help pages for the `mean()` and `median()` commands to see what the input argument `na.rm` does. Edit your code from exercise h so that it computes the summary statistics where data is available._

Not edited as done from the start.




## Question 7

_Which setting (inside, outside or mixed) has the largest mean visitor numbers in 2022?_

```{r Q7}
visitors %>% 
  group_by(setting) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_2022 = mean(n_2022),
    med_2022 = median(n_2022)
  )
```

### Exercise k.

_Observe in question 6 that the mean statistics across all settings are much larger than the corresponding median statistics. Discuss in your group what this suggests about the data._

This suggests that the data has some outliers with greatly more visits than the rest of the data set, which would not impact the median but would skew the data, hence the mean would be greater.




## Question 8

_What is the interquartile range (the width of the middle 50% of data set between the lower and upper quartiles) the for each of the four nations of the UK?_

```{r Q8}
visitors_with_nations <- visitors %>%
  mutate(
    nation = case_when(
      region == "Northern Ireland" ~ "Northern Ireland",
      region == "Scotland" ~ "Scotland",
      region == "Wales" ~ "Wales",
      TRUE ~ "England"
    )
  )

visitors_with_nations %>% 
  group_by(nation) %>%
  summarise(
    IQR_2022 = IQR(n_2022)
  )
```

### Exercise l.

_How many tourist attractions are there in each of the 4 nations? From this, discuss in your group how reliable you think the inter-quartile estimates are._


```{r Ex_l}
visitors_with_nations %>%
  group_by(nation) %>%
  count()
```



# Challenging Exercises

### Exercise m.

_Within each of the 4 nations, what is the proportion of tourist attractions that have free admission for all visitors?_

```{r Ex_m}
free_admission <- visitors_with_nations %>%
                    filter(admission == "Free")

england_free <- free_admission %>%
                  filter(nation == "England") %>%
                  nrow()
scotland_free <- free_admission %>%
                  filter(nation == "Scotland") %>%
                  nrow()
wales_free <- free_admission %>%
                  filter(nation == "Wales") %>%
                  nrow()
nireland_free <- free_admission %>%
                  filter(nation == "Northern Ireland") %>%
                  nrow()

england <- visitors_with_nations %>%
              filter(nation == "England") %>%
              nrow()
prop_eng <- england_free / england
scotland <- visitors_with_nations %>%
              filter(nation == "Scotland") %>%
              nrow()
prop_scot <- scotland_free / scotland
wales <- visitors_with_nations %>%
              filter(nation == "Wales") %>%
              nrow()
prop_wales <- wales_free / wales
nireland <- visitors_with_nations %>%
              filter(nation == "Northern Ireland") %>%
              nrow()
prop_ire <- nireland_free / nireland

proportions <- tibble(region = c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "Northern Ireland"),
                      c(prop_eng, prop_scot, prop_wales, prop_ire)
                      )
proportions

```


### Exercise n.

_Calculate the percentage change in visitor admissions from 2021 to 2022. Of the tourist attractions in Scotland, sort into increasing numerical order the types of admission charges based on the mean percentage change in visitor numbers._
